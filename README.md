# kotlin_polymorphism
Polymorphism in Kotlin, as in other object-oriented programming languages, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform operations in different ways depending on the objectâ€™s type, allowing for flexibility and the ability to extend functionality.

Types of Polymorphism
Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):
This is achieved by defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.

Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):
This occurs when a subclass overrides a method of its superclass. It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
